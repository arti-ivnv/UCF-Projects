We tried to do our best to make our compile work. It's working but not completely.
It should perfectly check the grammar, former a symbol table, and other. However,
we did not complete call operation; therefore, our Virtual machine stacks when you are
trying to use any call operations. There are also some different problems but we
honestly tried to do our best. By the way, thank you for your work and spending time
to grade our homework!

HOW TO RUN:
==========
Compile as following

gcc hw4compiler.c Scanner.c Parser.c CodeGen.c VM.c

./a.out [input file name].txt -l -a -v
