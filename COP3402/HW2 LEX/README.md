How to compile the LEX we programmed.

1. In order to run the program you will need to compile the code through terminal
using gcc command (being at the same folder with program and input files) as shown below:

gcc LEX.c


2. Next will be to execute the program and pass in the two files that will be
needed. You will need TO PROVIDE YOUR OWN input file in .txt format and for output
use just a name with a .txt format and the program will automatically create one or use already
existed file as well in .txt format. Follow example below:

./a.out [input file name].txt [output file name].txt

Example:

./a.out input.txt output.txt


3. Then to see the output after the program has been ran you will then need to
open the [output file name].txt (preferable text editor for output is Notepad).


4. Within the provided files you will find several:
   - LEX.c            Our program
   - input.txt        own created input
   - output.txt       our programs' output using own input

Recomended text editor to see output is Notepad.
