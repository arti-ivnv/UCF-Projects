# UCF-Projects
In this repository I have some but not all the projects from my university classes.

## COP 3223 (Introduction to Programming with C)
Course covers basic and some of the advanced concepts of a C language.


## COP 3330 (Object Oriented Programming using Java)
This course is designed to provide concepts in object oriented programming (classes, objects, methods, encapsulating, inheritance, interfaces) and the expression of these concepts in the programming language Java.  

Topics covered in this course include: classes; objects; methods; data types; algorithms; control structures; methods; container classes; inheritance; polymorphism; exception handling; graphical user interface (GUI); abstraction.  

## CDA 3103C (Computer Logic)
CDA 3103 introduces the concepts of Instruction Set Architecture and computing performance. This includes logic design, computer arithmetic, the MIPS assembly language, data path and control unit design, and memory hierarchies.

## CIS 3360 (Security in Computing)
This course is designed to provide a basic understanding security theory and practice for modern computing environments. Students will acquire proficiency in a number of classic and modern symmetric and public key cryptographic methods. Students will explore important topics in key exchange mechanisms; modes of operation; malware attacks, vulnerabilities, and defenses; network, web, and email security; digital rights management; and legal and ethical issues.

## COP 3402 (Systems Software)
This course is designed to provide a fundamental  understanding of real and virtual machines as language processor and the implementation of compilers. We will study the processor as an instruction interpreter. Compilers, assemblers,  linkers and loaders, and virtual machines will be presented as systems software  for program development. An introduction to Operating system will be given.

## COP 3502C (Computer Science 1)
This is an introductory course on data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms.

Developing formal, mathematical techniques for analyzing algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency.

Also covered:

recursion

data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, binary heaps, and hash tables

sorting techniques

search algorithms

## COP 3503C (Computer Science 2)
This is an advanced course on data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms.

Developing formal, mathematical techniques for analyzing algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency.

Also covered:
