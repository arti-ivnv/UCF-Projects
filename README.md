# UCF-Projects
In this repository I have the projects from my university classes.

## COP 3223 (Introduction to Programming with C)
Course covers basic and some of the advanced concepts of a C language.

## CDA 3103C (Computer Logic)
CDA 3103 introduces the concepts of Instruction Set Architecture and computing performance. This includes logic design, computer arithmetic, the MIPS assembly language, data path and control unit design, and memory hierarchies.

## CAP 4630

## CIS 3360 (Security in Computing)
This course is designed to provide a basic understanding security theory and practice for modern computing environments. Students will acquire proficiency in a number of classic and modern symmetric and public key cryptographic methods. Students will explore important topics in key exchange mechanisms; modes of operation; malware attacks, vulnerabilities, and defenses; network, web, and email security; digital rights management; and legal and ethical issues.

## COP 3402 (Systems Software)
This course is designed to provide a fundamental  understanding of real and virtual machines as language processor and the implementation of compilers. We will study the processor as an instruction interpreter. Compilers, assemblers,  linkers and loaders, and virtual machines will be presented as systems software  for program development. An introduction to Operating system will be given.

## COP 3502C

## COP 3503C

## COP 4020

## COP 4600

## COP 4710

## COP 3330 (Object Oriented Programming using Java)
This course is designed to provide concepts in object oriented programming (classes, objects, methods, encapsulating, inheritance, interfaces) and the expression of these concepts in the programming language Java.  

Topics covered in this course include: classes; objects; methods; data types; algorithms; control structures; methods; container classes; inheritance; polymorphism; exception handling; graphical user interface (GUI); abstraction.  


## P.S.
This repository created for the job searching purposes. Any cheating actions will go under the student conduct policies. Please be honest with your school and yourself.
